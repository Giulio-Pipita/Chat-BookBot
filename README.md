# Chat-BookBot

  This project is about chatbots and natural language processing.
  In this application there are two bots.
  Both of them have been created with langchain, open ai models, azure and streamlit for the graphic part.
  The first one is a rag application, which allows the user to chat with their own documents to retrieve useful informations.
  The other one ("BookBot") is a bot capable of creating book summary and book reports, starting from a book as an input.
